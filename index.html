            <p>Hello! I'm Vijaya Lakshmi Gupta, an accomplished Data Engineer with over a decade of experience in Digital Marketing and Business Intelligence. I have recently transitioned to a Senior Business Analyst role, where I continue to leverage my expertise in developing analytical frameworks and leading cross-functional teams to enhance data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a knack for translating complex data into actionable business insights. My journey began with a strong foundation in engineering, and over the years, I have honed my skills in various aspects of data engineering and business intelligence. My technical toolkit includes SQL, Python, GCP BigQuery, Databricks, and a range of data visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Looker.</p>

<h3>Professional Highlights:</h3>

<h4>Leadership:</h4> At Albertsons Companies, I led a team of data engineers and business intelligence analysts, driving the design and development of analytical databases and dashboards that significantly improved informed decision-making processes.
<h4>Innovation:</h4> Pioneered the expansion of data analytics, reporting, and dashboarding capabilities within organizations, implementing automated reporting solutions that streamlined operations and enhanced efficiency.
<h4>Collaboration:</h4> Successfully facilitated cross-functional collaboration between stakeholders, end-users, and teams to deliver comprehensive data solutions for projects at EPAM and Slice.
<h4>Impact:</h4> Engineered a data product at Zazzle that generated $750k USD in revenue and $250k USD in cost savings for a single quarter, reducing manual efforts for the in-house SEM team by 90%.

Whether it's through developing sophisticated data models or creating intuitive dashboards, I thrive on making data accessible and valuable for decision-makers.
